    "## Installing Python 3 with Anaconda\n",
    "Here's a bash script to set up the environment. It's just a regular Linux instance (Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS - ami-66506c1c) with Anaconda's Python 3, Jupyter Notebook, git, and htop installed. Presumably, you can get an Azure Ubuntu instance and run the same bash script.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Start your AWS instance.  \n",
    "2) After your instance starts, under \"INSTANCES\" click on \"Instances\" button to see all your instances.  \n",
    "3) On the far right side (you probably have to scroll to the right side), under the \"Security Group\" tab, click on your instance, which will probably say \"launch-wizard-xx\".  \n",
    "4) At the bottom of the screen, click \"Inbound\" tab, then \"Edit\", and then \"Add Rule\".  Set Port Range to be ```8888``` and the Source is ```0.0.0.0/0```  \n",
    "The point of this is to allow your local computer to connect to the remote VM through Jupyter Notebook.  \n",
    "5) After ssh-ing into your instance, run the following bash commands. You can simply copy and paste the whole thing at once though line by line is probably safer. Or you can save to a bash script and run it from Terminal.\n",

    "If you want a more secure way of connecting to Jupyter Notebook (like non-public ports), you'll have to ask Aaditya for advice! The good thing is that when Python 3's Jupyter Notebook starts up, it prints a password token, which you copy and paste into the browser for Jupyter Notebook. Python 2's Jupyter Notebook does not have this token password. I use ```tmux``` when I use Jupyter Notebook to make sure I don't accidentally stop the notebook server. \n",
