    "## Setup\n",
    "__User-Defined Function (UDF)__: The user creates a function that is the MCE argument ```function_to_process``` which has the following mandatory arguments: ```input_file_name, cluster_output_dir, cluster_id, n_cpus, cpu_id```. The MCE passes those keyword arguments into the UDF, so your UDF must take them in but doesn't have to use it. In the following example UDF, ```save_a_string``` just saves to file a couple strings. Notice that the UDF must import any of the libraries it uses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__MCE arguments__:  This must be a dictionary which has keyword arguments you pass into the MCE instance. It must has the following arguments (which everything you see in the example):  \n",
    "* cluster_job_name: what ever you like to name the cluster job. This will help create the final output directory, so use a string that doesn't have any weird characters or spaces. \n",
    "* n_cpus_list: number of CPUs for each cluster. Largest cluster in the beginning; for example: [5, 2, 2]. You should rarely make a cluster with 1 CPU because then it would defeat the purpose of multi-CPU map-reduce.\n",
    "* ram_limit_in_GB: threshold for total RAM usage across all clusters. If clusters use more RAM, then it will automatically kill the cluster that uses the most RAM.   \n",
    "* wait_time_in_seconds: the number of seconds between profiling RAM and determining whether if any cluster is available to send the next file. I just use 1 second, so it profiles every second. \n",
    "* input_file_names: a list of file names. Absolute paths are preferred as relative path not guaranteed to work. \n",
    "* output_parent_dir: Directory of the parent folder that will contain the final output directory. Absolute path preferred and this directory has to already exist.\n",
    "* function_to_process: Your UDF here\n",
    "* function_kwargs_dict: an argument dictionary that is specific to your UDF. If your UDF takes no extra arguments than the mandatory arguments, then put an empty dictionary here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__MCE instance__: The instance of the MultipleClusterEngine class which you instantiate with your mce arguments dictionary. To run the whole thing, just call the main() method, which will call the following methods: \n",
    "* create_cluster_output_dir(): create the final output directory, which is based on your output_parent_dir + cluster_job_name + a uniquely incremented number\n",
    "* start_all_clusters(): starts all the clusters with the number of CPUs you set\n",
    "* run_clusters(): doles out the files to be processed by the clusters. Most of the runtime should be here\n",
    "* kill_all_clusters(): kills all the clusters when the processing is completed. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging: \n",
    "If MCE.main() finishes without error, the clusters will naturally be killed and everything is fine. Sometimes if your UDF fails or something weird happens, kill_all_clusters() won't work. You have to go ```htop``` or ```ps aux``` to see if the cluster is still running. For the following example, to manually kill the clusters:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# kill each of the 3 clusters since n_cpus_list has length 3\n",
    "!ipcluster stop --profile save_to_string_0\n",
    "!ipcluster stop --profile save_to_string_1\n",
    "!ipcluster stop --profile save_to_string_2\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Also, once a file has been sent to a cluster, you cannot stop it from inside Python. Hence, you have to manually kill the cluster to get the job to stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "__```MCE.cluster_output_dir```__: This is the final output directory which is composed of ```output_parent_dir``` + ```cluster_job_name``` + a uniquely incremented number. Hence, it is safe to run the same code with same configurations, as the output will be written to a different final output directory. Moreover, you will know which is the latest run, as the directory will have the highest number.  \n",
    "__logging__: MCE will generate 3 logs which always include time stamps: ```status.log```, ```ram_usage.log```, ```failure.log```. \n",
    "* ```status.log``` will tell you when the clusters started, which files were sent to which clusters, if any clusters are prematurely killed, when the clusters are killed after processing has been completed, and how many files appear to be successfully processed on how many remaining clusters. If certain files failed to process successfully (for example, if a invoice file has a different delimiter than the others, then your function will fail), then the number of files successfully processed will be less than the length of ```input_file_names```. If a cluster was killed prematurely (probably due to exceeding RAM limit), then the number of surviving clusters will be less than length of ```n_cpus_list```. Basically, for a quick sanity check, see if number of files successfully processed equals the length of your input files--which would indicate everything worked out smoothly. Of course, please do separate sanity check and look at your files to make sure things actually did work out correctly. \n",
    "* ```ram_usage.log```: Every ```wait_time_in_seconds```, RAM usage for each cluster (and the sum to get all clusters) is recorded. If RAM usage exceeds ```ram_limit_in_GB```, then cluster will automatically kill the cluster using the most RAM and record here the cluster number and which file it was processing. \n",
    "* ```failure.log```: If a function failed on a file, then the cluster number, error type, and file name will be recorded here. Also, if RAM usage exceeds ```ram_limit_in_GB```, a message will be recorded here too. If everything worked out perfectly, this file will be empty. The goal is to have this file be empty.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__```MCE.async_results_dict```__: basically the instance attribute that records the history of everything MCE did"

    "__```mce5.cluster_output_dir```__: the final output directory is ```/home/ubuntu/cluster_results/get_user_invoice_total_1``` the first time you run this code. Weird. It should be ```get_user_invoice_total_1```. Must be a small bug. \n",

    "* ```ram_usage.log```: Every 1 second, RAM usage for each cluster (and the sum to get all clusters) is recorded. RAM never gets very high. \n",
    "* ```failure.log```: Empty. Perfect! \n",

    "__```mce5.async_results_dict```__: basically the history of everything MCE did. For example:\n",
